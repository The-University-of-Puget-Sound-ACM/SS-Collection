    npm install
* To set up the database (on an empty mongodb):
    * Run `python binparse.py locations.xlsx`
    * The fresh file generated is a json representation of the bin definitions.
    * Start your mongo instance with mongod '--dbpath SS-Collection/data'
    * Run `mongoimport --db ss-collection --collection bin_defs --file json_bins.txt`
    * If the above command worked, you should have many bins in your mongodb.
